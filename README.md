# FormEmu

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App] Project created to pass a challenge.

## Description

The main goal of this app is to send your personal information to a database and to read it on a different route ("/results").
\
Before you can submit you need to complete all fields. 
\
Also you cant access to route "/results" route without previously sending information to the database.
\
The code is theme based so it can easily change colors or spacing.
\
Its as complex as the challenge.
